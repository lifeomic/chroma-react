# Lined Custom Icons

A custom-designed set of lined icons exposed by Chroma. The lined custom set is
designed in-house by LifeOmic but takes inspiration from the
[feather icon set](https://feathericons.com/).

<!-- STORY -->

## Import

```js
import { AccessPolicy } from '@lifeomic/chroma-react/icons/linedCustom';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<AccessPolicy />
```

### Icon Colors

By default, the `fill` for each icon is set to `currentColor`. To style an icon
with a color of your choice, use:

```jsx
// Container sets color
<div style={{ color: 'black' }}>
  <AccessPolicy />
</div>

// Set fill directly
<AccessPolicy fill="black" />
```
