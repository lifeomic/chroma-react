# Icons Overview

**NOTE:** These icons are deprecated in favor of using [Chromicons](https://github.com/lifeomic/chromicons) directly and will be removed in a future release.  The Chromicons viewer can be found at https://lifeomic.github.io/chromicons.com/.

Chroma provides different variations of icons:

**Lined**: The default icon style, based off of feather icon set.

**Lined Custom**: The lined custom set is designed in-house by LifeOmic but
takes inspiration from the feather icon set.

**Oblique**: These are the sidebar icons that represent top level pages or
sections.

**Filled**: These are icons that include full background colors.

**Adaptive**: These icons are a combination of the filled and line where there
are portions of the icon are filled and lined and use negative space.
